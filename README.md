### 👋 Hi there, I'm @jessedt13

🚀 I'm transitioning into the IT and cybersecurity world with a strong foundation in business and tech. I hold a B.S. in Management Information Systems and I'm currently pursuing an AAS in Cybersecurity.

🛠️ I love working on hands-on tech projects—from spinning up local servers to experimenting with open-source tools and automation. Recently, I've been building an IT dashboard using Apache and Linux, and diving deep into cybersecurity through CompTIA Security+ prep.

🔧 Technical interests:
- IT support and system administration
- Network security & threat mitigation
- Home lab builds (Linux, VMs, firewalls, etc.)
- Automation with PowerShell and Python
- Local tech solutions for small businesses

🌱 Always learning: I’m continuously growing my skills in cybersecurity, Linux, and cloud services.

📬 Feel free to reach out or explore my projects—always open to collaborating and connecting!
